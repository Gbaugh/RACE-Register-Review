# RACE-Register-Review
The RAcE team in Nigeria has observed that their current system of collecting routine M&E data for program performance monitoring is not set up to collect all pneumonia indicators or allow for sex disaggregation of key case management and treatment indicators. As a result, WHO has requested that grantees conduct supplemental surveys on a bi-annual basis to capture the information.  The request as articulated by WHO is to “review a sample of the CORP registers for cases by gender and the pneumonia indicators.”
